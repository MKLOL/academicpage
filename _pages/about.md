## About me

My name is Dragos Ristache and I'm currently a PhD student at Boston University under the supervision of [Sofya Raskhodnikova](https://cs-people.bu.edu/sofya/). I did my undergraduate at University of Southampton, then did a masters at Cornell University and finally worked in industry a few years before returning to pursue my PhD.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, with a focus on graphs and sublinear algorithms.
